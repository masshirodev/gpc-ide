## High Priority

- [x] Accourding to Swizzy, if the script doesn't have a Modules folder, the IDE blocks him from doing pretty much anything. Perhaps ensure script structure when you select it on the sidebar?
- [ ] Make the sidebar show on top of the content area, so it doesnt move the content when it opens.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Repeatable modules? Like a generic button pressing combos that I can set names, buttons to press, etc with a GUI and Code tab?
- [ ] Combo maker
- [x] Image creator
- [ ] Problems window to the bottom of the IDE, like a console that shows errors and warnings. Maybe also a tab for logs?
- [ ] "Find in script folder" and "Replace in script folder" with a sidebar tab that shows the results and allows you to click on them to jump to the line in the code?
- [ ] Swap to Ari's new LSP server.
