## High Priority

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Repeatable modules? Like a generic button pressing combos that I can set names, buttons to press, etc with a GUI and Code tab?
- [x] Saving a file pops the "Modified elsewhere" modal
- [x] Change console type (changing it changes the buttons used in the IDE: PS5_CROSS -> XB1_A)
- [ ] Combo maker
- [ ] Image creator ( @TODO: check how jimmy does on his app or get some examples on discord)
