## High Priority

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Repeatable modules? Like a generic button pressing combos that I can set names, buttons to press, etc with a GUI and Code tab?
- [ ] game info filename: "{username}-{gameabbr}-v{version}"; title: "{game}-v{version}" (these are ui variables, like {version} we already have) - defaults

## Low Priority
