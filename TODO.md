## High Priority

- [x] Accourding to Swizzy, if the script doesn't have a Modules folder, the IDE blocks him from doing pretty much anything. Perhaps ensure script structure when you select it on the sidebar?
- [x] Make the sidebar show on top of the content area, so it doesnt move the content when it opens.
- [x] Animation output isnt functional. Refactor it.

## Medium Priority

- [x] Combo maker
- [x] Image creator
- [x] "Problems" window to the bottom of the IDE, like a console that shows errors and warnings. Maybe also a tab for logs?
- [x] "Find in script folder" and "Replace in script folder" with a sidebar tab that shows the results and allows you to click on them to jump to the line in the code?
- [x] Add more Aim Assist modules. Maybe add a aim assist editor too? not sure.
- [ ] Swap to Ari's new LSP server.

## Low Priority

- [ ] Fix pre-existing errors.
- [ ] Hide closed sidebar when sidebar is open.
