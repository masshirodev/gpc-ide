## High Priority

- [ ] Flow Editor: Submenu nodes with settings are being created with the same var names by default.
- [ ] Flow Editor: Profiles.
- [ ] Flow Editor: Inputs dont save if you click out of them, only if you click on the sidebar or press Enter.
- [ ] Check how the plugins are going to integrate with the flow editor, and if it needs any change.

## Medium Priority

- [ ] Redesign the dashboard.
- [ ] Flow Editor: On condition Button Press and Button Hold, add combinations, so the user can add something like L2+Options (L2 would be check with get_val and Options with event_release or something)
- [ ] Flow Editor: Add subnode type "Blank", so users can have blank rows.
